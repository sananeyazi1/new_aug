"" Tiger Woods is hitting his stride on a march to the Masters.<p>Woods had full control of his game Sunday and never let anyone get closer than three shots until he had locked up his 17th World Golf Championship title. With a conservative bogey that didn't matter on the final hole, he closed with a 1-under 71 to win the Cadillac Championship.<p>For the first time in five years, Woods has two wins before the Masters.<p>It was one year ago at Doral that Woods withdrew after 11 holes in the final round because of tightness in his left Achilles tendon, creating uncertainty about his health and whether he could ever get his game back.<p>False alarm.<p>Woods has won five times in the last year, the most of anyone in the world, and he can return to No. 1 with a win at Bay Hill in two weeks.<p>He won by two shots over Steve Stricker, who might want to claim a share of this trophy.<p>Stricker spent 45 minutes on the putting green with Woods on the eve of the tournament, helping him with his posture over putts. Woods made 27 birdies this week, one short of his personal best on the PGA Tour.<p>"Thank you to Steve for the putting lesson,"ù Woods said at the trophy presentation. "It was one of those weeks where I felt pretty good about how I was playing, made a few putts and got it rolling."ù<p>Stricker, playing a part-time schedule, picked up his second runner-up finish in just three starts. He closed with a 68, and had no regrets about offering Woods some help.<p>"At times you kick yourself,"ù Stricker said with a laugh. "He's a good friend. We talk a lot about putting. It's good to see him playing well."ù<p>The Masters is a month away, and Woods is sure to be the favorite.<p>Rory McIlroy, the No. 1 player in the world, showed signs of recovering from his rough start to the season. He had a 65 and tied for eighth.<p>Woods won in January at Torrey Pines by four shots. He won for the fourth time at Doral, making this the seventh golf course where he has won at least four times.<p>Graeme McDowell, who started the final round four shots behind, made a birdie on the opening hole, but never got any closer. McDowell had third place to himself until he went for the green on the 18th hole and found the water. He made double bogey, shot 72 and fell into a four-way tie for third that cost him $172,500.<p>Phil Mickelson (71), Sergio Garcia (69) and Adam Scott (64) also tied for third.<p>Woods improved to 40-2 on the PGA Tour when he had the outright lead going into the final round, the last two wins with McDowell at his side. Woods last won while ahead at Bay Hill a year ago.<p>"The way Tiger was playing, I was always in chase mode,"ù McDowell said. "He was always going to be a tough guy to catch. Fair play to him. He played fantastic golf the last couple of days."ù<p>Woods finished minus 19 at 269 and earned $1.5 million in winning this World Golf Championship for the seventh time.<p>McIlroy's week ended on a happy note.<p>Not only did he finish the tournament, he might have turned the corner with a bogey-free 65. McIlroy opened with a 7-iron into 18 feet for eagle, which he called one of the best shots he hit. He shot a 32 on the back nine for a round that surprised him considering how far away he felt when he arrived at Doral.<p>"Just goes to show, it's not as far away as you think,"ù McIlroy said. "That's been one of my problems. I always think when I'm playing bad that it's further away than it is. That's just where I have to stay patient ... and know that if I put in the hard work, that the results will bear fruit. Whether that's sooner or later, it doesn't really matter."ù<p>McIlroy said he won't add a tournament the next two weeks, returning at the Houston Open before going to the Masters. He is signed up for the member-guest a week from Monday at The Medalist Club, presumably as the guest of former NBA great Michael Jordan.<p>"He's asked me, so depending on what my schedule is and where I have to be ... we'll see,"ù he said.<p>Scott had the low round of the tournament with eight birdies in his round of 64.<p>That's what McDowell, Mickelson and Stricker would have needed to have any chance of catching Woods. As he did early in third round, McDowell gave it his best shot, only to have Woods answer on every occasion.<p>McDowell two-putted for birdie on the par-5 opening hole as Woods blasted a shot from a buried lie at the back of the green well past the pin and off the green. He had to chip close just to save par. McDowell hit his approach on the second hole to 7 feet and looked as if he might pick up another shot.<p>In what might have been the most significant putt Woods made, he buried an 18-footer for birdie.<p>That's how it went all weekend. Woods never gave anyone a chance, and he didn't give anyone much hope. His lead was back to four shots, he hit an 8-iron to 4 feet on the par-3 fourth hole, and no one seriously challenged him the rest of the way.<p>Mickelson hit a 200-yard shot into the breeze and over the water to a foot for a tap-in birdie on the par-5 eighth to get within four shots with 10 holes to play. He missed far too many short putts, however, making bogey on the ninth and 11th holes to fall too far back to matter.<p>That allowed another easy walk up the 18th hole for Woods to collect another WGC title, another seven-figure check, and offer another reminder that he is closer than ever to getting back to the top of golf.<p>Woods now has won over $24 million in the WGCs alone since the series began in 1999, winning 43 percent of the tournaments. This was his 76th career win on tour, leaving him six short of the record 82 wins by Sam Snead.</p></span></div>
<div><img src="http://masterssquid.augusta.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/590_wide/12032676.jpg" /><span title="Thompson wins first tour event at Honda Classic"><img src="http://masterssquid.augusta.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/590_wide/12032676.jpg" /><p>PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. "" On a long, hard day at the Honda Classic, Michael Thompson relied on a superb short game to win for the first time on the PGA Tour.<p>Thompson seized control early with a 50-foot eagle putt on the third hole, then kept his distance with clutch par saves and closed with a birdie from the bunker. It gave him a 1-under 69 "" one of only five rounds under par at PGA National "" and a two-shot win over Geoff Ogilvy.<p>"This week was magical,"ù Thompson said. "Just had a groove and kept feeling it."ù<p>It was a big week for Ogilvy, too.<p>The former U.S. Open champion had plunged to No. 79 in the world ranking and already missed the Match Play Championship. He was prepared for another week off next week until putting together four solid rounds.<p>He chipped in from behind the 16th green for birdie and two-putted for birdie on the 18th for a 69. The runner-up finish moves him into the top 50 (No. 47) and gets him into the World Golf Championship at Doral.<p>Luke Guthrie, tied with Thompson for the 54-hole lead, fell behind with a bogey on the second hole and closed with a 73 to finish third.<p>Tiger Woods was never in the picture.<p>He started the final round eight shots behind, and whatever hopes he had of a rally ended on the sixth hole when he hit his drive so far to the right that the ball was never found.<p>Woods took double bogey, and only an eagle on the final hole kept the damage to a minimum. He closed with a 74 "" his first time since the Masters last year that he failed to break par in any round of a 72-hole tournament "" and tied for 37th.<p>It was the second straight year Woods closed with an eagle at PGA National "" the difference was last year, it gave him a 62 and a tie for second.<p>"I think I passed 62 somewhere around 12,"ù Woods said.<p>Despite a bogey on the final hole, Erik Compton had a 70 and was part of the five-way tie for fourth. Compton, who already has had two heart transplants, earned his first top-10 finish on the PGA Tour.<p>Thompson, who finished at 9-under 271, had made only one cut this year and finished at the bottom of the back. He was solid from the start Sunday on another windswept day in south Florida, one of only three players who shot par or better all four rounds.<p>"You don't have to do much wrong to be making a bogey out there, so it's pretty impressive,"ù Ogilvy said of Thompson's final round. "It's a great effort, really. As you say by the rest of the scores, it's a very hard golf course and it seems to get progressively harder in some ways. There's a disaster waiting everywhere.<p>"There's a lot of golf courses on tour that it might be easy to close out a golf tournament "" or easier "" but this is not one of them."ù<p>Thompson dropped only one shot on the back nine, a three-putt on the 16th when he missed from just inside 3 feet. He rattled another short par putt in on the 17th, and then played away from the water on his second shot at the par-5 18th, into a bunker. Once his ball stopped rolling 4 feet from the cup, the tournament was over.<p>The win moves Thompson to No. 45 in the world and gets him into his first World Golf Championship next week.<p>"This is everything,"ù Thompson said. "This is a childhood dream come true. I've dreamed of playing out here since I was 7 years old and to win, it's just unbelievable. I just can't put it into words. The whole day was awesome."ù<p>It was a mess for Woods.<p>He lost two balls in a span of eight holes (the other one in the third round Saturday) for what he believes is the first time in his career. He hit into the water on the 11th for another double bogey, and drove into the water on the 16th.<p>"I just made too many penalties this week,"ù Woods said. "Today is a perfect example. I didn't play that poorly. I had two water balls and a lost ball. Take those away, and I missed two short birdie putts, and it was actually a decent score. So just got to clean up my rounds."ù<p>The final round was never going to be easy with the wind whipping on PGA National, and it showed. Of those who finished before the leaders even teed off, only two players managed to break par. Scoring was so difficult that Lucas Glover played the weekend in 2-over par and still tied for fourth.<p>"You don't move up very often "" on tour "" over par on the weekend, except for a place like this,"ù Glover said.<p>Thompson seized control early because of some big putts, and mostly because so many others faded.<p>It was a wild front nine for Thompson, with only three pars, which ordinarily would spell disaster on a day like this except for his putting.<p>He made a 50-foot eagle putt on the third hole, made a 12-foot birdie putt behind the hole at the par-3 fifth hole and hit an approach into 4 feet for birdie on the eighth. Just as big was the tough sixth hole, where Thompson hit a bunker shot 18 feet over the flag and made the par putt coming back.<p>Guthrie, who fell behind for good with a bogey on the second hole, did his best to stay in range until hitting his tee shot out of bounds on the 14th for a double bogey. From there, it was only a battle for second place.<p>Everyone else was long gone.<p>Westwood failed to save par on consecutive holes on the front nine and could never catch up. Charles Howell III, who started the day three shots behind and needed a win to get to the Masters in his hometown, fell apart on the back nine with a 41 and closed with a 78.<p>He at least gets into Doral next week through his FedEx Cup standing. Rickie Fowler made three bogeys on the first six holes and was never a factor.<p>Thompson's short game was superb during the pivotal part of the final round. He twice chipped to tap-in range for par on the 10th and 11th holes, and he built a four-shot lead with four holes to play. The only thing that kept him from an easy walk to this first win was Ogilvy's late birdies.</p></span></div>
<div><img src="http://masterssquid.augusta.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/590_wide/12022049.jpg" /><span title="Bubba Watson doing things his way as Masters champ"><img src="http://masterssquid.augusta.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/590_wide/12022049.jpg" /><p>Bubba Watson is known for doing things his own way, and he's blazing a new trail as the reigning Masters Tournament champion.<p>From keeping his green jacket largely hidden from public view to shunning the tradition of disclosing details about his Champions Dinner menu, Watson has become the undercover champion.<p>"I think as Masters champion I should be allowed to just wait to tell everybody,&rdquo; Watson said when asked about what he's chosen to serve his fellow champions and Augusta National Golf Club chairman Billy Payne at the annual dinner.<p>So whether he'll bring in some North Carolina barbecue; something scattered, smothered and covered from Waffle House; or just traditional meat and potatoes off the club menu will not be revealed until after the Tuesday night soiree in the Augusta clubhouse. Those people around the world who like to replicate the champions meal as part of their own Masters traditions will have to be patient.<p>"Yeah, they'll have to replicate it the day after, I guess,&rdquo; Watson said.<p>Secrecy hasn't been the only idiosyncrasy that Watson has brought to his year in the spotlight. Aside from his immediate media blitz in the two days after his victory in April, Watson has kept the green jacket that's in his possession for a year largely out of sight.<p>The only other time he's taken it out of the garment bag in his closet was to pose for a cover photo for The Augusta Chronicle's Masters preview section.<p>"You know, out of respect for the Masters and Augusta National and all their members, I haven't done anything with the jacket,&rdquo; Watson said. "I wore it for media day up in New York. They've asked me to do a photo shoot, so I wore it one time for a photo shoot for Augusta. And then it's been in my closet hidden away. None of my friends have seen it. None of my friends have taken photos of it. It's been in its &ndash; what do you call it &ndash; the garment bag. They give you a garment bag with 2012 Masters champ on it.<p>"But it's been sitting in that garment bag. I haven't taken it out. I don't let anybody see it or take pictures of it out of respect for the tournament and out of respect for the members of Augusta National.&rdquo;<p>Watson's actions are in stark contrast to his immediate predecessor, Charl Schwartzel. The 2011 champion from South Africa would personally cook a traditional "braai&rdquo; with monkey gland sauce for media and friends who wanted to know what he planned to serve his fellow champions. And he never went anywhere in the world for 12 months without his green jacket in tow, and he would gladly take it out for friends at parties or sometimes just take a peek at it in his hotel rooms just to remind himself of the achievement.<p>Watson marches to his own tune.<p>"Since we came back to our house here in Scottsdale (Ariz.), I haven't seen it,&rdquo; he said of the jacket. "I put it in the back (of my closet). I know it's there just because I don't want anybody to steal that thing, but I know it's there. But no, I don't look at it, I don't ever see it. I can see the corner of it because it's like back with my jackets, so I can see the corner of the green garment bag so I know it's there at all times, but I don't ever glance at it or anything like that.&rdquo;<p>Watson also has no plans to rush down the 10th fairway upon his return to Augusta National and try to recreate the dramatic hook from the woods that won him the Masters on the second playoff hole. Former champions who have won on similarly heroic shots &ndash; such as Sandy Lyle and Angel Cabrera &ndash; have been known to relive those famous moments over and over in ensuing years.<p>"So I don't have any reason to go over there. Hopefully I hit the fairway from now on so I don't need to practice that shot anymore.&rdquo;</p></span></div>
<div><span title="Matt Kuchar beats Hunter Mahan in Match Play Championship"><p>MARANA, Ariz. &mdash; Matt Kuchar finally put Hunter Mahan in a hole and then answered every challenge Sunday to win the Match Play Championship.<p>Mahan had gone 169 holes over 11 matches without trailing in this wild tournament until Kuchar won the fourth hole of their championship match with a par, and Mahan never caught up. Kuchar took advantage of a series of miscues to build a 4-up lead at the turn, and then held off a noble challenge by the defending champion.<p>There was never a dull moment on the back nine. Only two holes were halved, and those were with birdies.<p>But for all the great shots, the match ended when Mahan went from a tough lie in the bunker to a bush in the desert, and it took him four shots to reach the 17th green. Kuchar wound up winning, 2 and 1, when Mahan removed the stocking cap he used to fight the cold desert air and conceded Kuchar a short birdie putt.<p>It was the first World Golf Championship title for Kuchar, and it follows a year in which he won The Players Championship. Kuchar became the second player in the last three years to win the Match Play Championship without ever playing the 18th hole.<p>Mahan was trying to join Tiger Woods as the only back-to-back winners, and he gave it a good shot despite the big deficit halfway through the match.<p>In a strong, cold wind &mdash; the wind chill index reached a low of 37 degrees on the final day &mdash; Mahan made a long two-putt par to win the 10th, and played a tough chip from the mound of a bunker to about 6 feet for a birdie on the next hole, cutting the lead in half.<p>Mahan followed with a tee shot into about 10 feet on the par-3 12th, the momentum squarely on his side.<p>Kuchar, however, followed with a tee shot to just inside 15 feet and made the birdie putt. On the par-5 13th, Mahan hit a poor approach from the fairway and Kuchar got up-and-down to restore his lead to 3 up.<p>Kuchar came up with one more clutch shot. With a 2-up lead on the 304-yard 15th hole, the breeze at his back, Kuchar chipped about 10 feet past the hole with Mahan only 6 feet away for birdie. Kuchar holed the putt and escaped with a halve.<p>Mahan won the 16th with a two-putt par when Kuchar's tee shot bounced off the corporate tents behind the green, and it look as though the match would go down the 18th for the first time in nine matches for Kuchar. Both hit into the fairway bunker, but Mahan's ball was slightly sunk in the sand, and his approach never came close to reaching the green. Instead, rolled through a patch of desert until it lodged in a bush.<p>Kuchar's record in this event improved to 15-3, the highest winning percentage of anyone who has played at least 10 matches. He has reached the quarterfinals each of the last three years, and this time went all the way.<p>He played 96 holes and only trailed after four holes all week.<p>Kuchar polished off Jason Day of Australia in the semifinals Saturday morning, 4 and 3.<p>Mahan hit a series of remarkable wedge shots in beating Ian Poulter, 4 and 3, in his semifinal. He twice hit difficult chips inside 5 feet to win holes, and then seized control with a chip-in from about 70 feet on the 12th hole to take command.<p>Day defeated Poulter in the consolation match, 1 up.<p>It was the first all-American final in five years at the Match Play Championship, and Kuchar's win gave the Americans a clean sweep of the PGA Tour's West Coast Swing for the second straight year.<p>He moves to No. 8 in the world and picked up $1.5 million, and now has earned just over $3.2 million from his last two wins.</p></span></div>
<div><img src="http://masterssquid.augusta.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/590_wide/Obama_Luci.jpg" /><span title="Obama, Tiger Woods play golf"><img src="http://masterssquid.augusta.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/590_wide/Obama_Luci.jpg" /><p>PALM CITY, Fla. &mdash; President Barack Obama teed it up with Tiger Woods on Sunday.<p>The White House confirmed that the President and the world's most famous golfer played a round at a secluded, exclusive yacht and golf club on Florida's Treasure Coast.<p>Once the sport's dominant player before his career was sidetracked by scandal, Woods joined Obama at the Floridian, where Obama is spending the long Presidents Day weekend. The two had met before, but Sunday was the first time they played together.<p>The White House, which has promised to be the most open and transparent in history, has prohibited any media coverage of Obama's golf outing.<p>The foursome also included Jim Crane, a Houston businessman who owns the Floridian and baseball's Houston Astros, and outgoing U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, a former mayor of Dallas, said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Crane and Kirk also were part of Obama's foursome on Saturday, the White House said.<p>Obama, an avid golfer, also received some instruction Saturday and played a few holes with Butch Harmon, Woods' former swing coach.<p>Initial word that the First Duffer would play a round with the world's No. 2 player didn't come from the White House, but instead came from veteran golf journalist Tim Rosaforte, who announced it on Twitter. Rosaforte's late-morning tweet said: "The president is arriving at the Floridian range. Awaiting is Tiger Woods and club owner Jim Crane. Historic day in golf. Their first round.&rdquo;<p>White House confirmation of Woods' participation came about two hours later, following multiple appeals from traveling White House reporters.<p>Golf Digest reported on its website that Obama spent eight hours Saturday with Harmon, playing 27 holes and hitting balls in Harmon's studio, and then managed to coordinate Sunday's round with Woods. The report said the original plan called for Obama and Woods, a Florida resident, to play at Woods' home club &mdash; The Medalist Golf Club, a half-hour away in Hobe Sound. But they eventually opted for the Floridian.<p>Woods departed Sunday after the first 18 holes, with Obama staying on to play another nine, the report said.<p>"Just to see the interaction between the two on the range was pretty neat,&rdquo; Harmon told Golf Digest. "The President said to Tiger: &lsquo;The last tournament you played was fun to watch. It's good to see you play well again.' You could tell he meant it. It just wasn't a throw it out compliment.&rdquo;<p>It seems Obama and Woods &mdash; the first black men at the top of their respective fields &mdash; have spent the past few years inching toward Sunday's meeting on the fairway.<p>They met in January 2009, during Obama's inauguration in Washington. Four months later, in April, Woods visited the White House and Obama received him in the Oval Office.<p>Woods' personal life imploded later in 2009 after revelations that he had engaged in multiple extramarital affairs, leading to divorce. He followed with a public apology and announced he was taking an indefinite break from golf. Shortly after Woods announced he was coming out of seclusion, Obama said in an interview with Fox News Channel that Woods will still be a "terrific&rdquo; golfer despite his personal issues.<p>After returning to the sport, Woods went two years without winning, but his game is back on track and he currently is ranked No. 2 in the world. Woods won the last tournament he played, three weeks ago in San Diego.<p>The White House made clear from the start of Obama's trip that there would be no coverage of him because he would be on vacation with no plans to leave the club, which remained open to members and their guests.<p>It arranged for the pool of reporters who traveled with Obama to bunk at a Holiday Inn about a 20-minute drive away in Port St. Lucie. Whenever the reporters were brought to the Floridian on the off chance that Obama might leave the property, they were taken no further than a maintenance shed beyond the club gates but on the edge of the grounds.<p>The presence at the Floridian of a professional journalist who tweeted about Obama's game as he was playing, while White House reporters essentially were locked out, brought a sharp response from Ed Henry, the Fox News Channel correspondent who also is president of the White House Correspondents' Association.<p>"A broad cross section of our members from print, radio, online and TV have today expressed extreme frustration to me about having absolutely no access to the president of the United States this entire weekend,&rdquo; Henry said in a statement. "There is a very simple but important principle we will continue to fight for today and in the days ahead: transparency.&rdquo;<p>In response, Earnest, the White House spokesman said: "The press access granted by the White House today is entirely consistent with the press access offered for previous presidential golf outings. It's also consistent with the press access promised to the White House Press Corps prior to arrival in Florida on Friday evening.&rdquo;<p>Previous administrations have allowed brief news media coverage at either the beginning or the end of presidential golf games. Obama's policy generally is no coverage at all, but exceptions were made for separate outings he had in 2011 with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and former President Bill Clinton.<p>Golf Channel said Rosaforte is a member of the Floridian who sent his tweets from the clubhouse. Rosaforte did not have access to the course or to Obama, the network said.<p>Obama is in Florida while his wife and daughters are on an annual ski vacation out West. He was due to arrive back in Washington on Monday night.</p></span></div>

On Sunday, he did better than that. He won it.<p>Merrick hit two clutch shots that led to par in a sudden-death playoff and won the Northern Trust Open on Sunday when Charlie Beljan missed a 5-foot par putt on the second extra hole. It was the first PGA Tour win for Merrick, who went to school at UCLA.<p>Merrick closed with a 69. Beljan, famous for his anxiety attack when he won at Disney last year, holed an 18-foot birdie on the 18th hole for a 67.<p>Along with his first win on tour, the 30-year-old Merrick earns a spot in the Masters.<p>In his two Masters appearances, Merrick finished in a tie for 6th in 2009 but missed the cut in 2010.</p></span></div>

<div><span title="USGA doing away with Public Links tournaments"><p>FAR HILLS, N.J. "" The U.S. Golf Association is adding its first championship in more than 25 years, getting rid of the U.S. Amateur Public Links in favor of a U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship to meet what it says is a trend at the state and regional level.<p>The Four-Ball Championship "" one tournament for men, one for women "" will start in 2015.<p>Adding these two tournaments means the end of two others, however. That includes the U.S. Amateur Public Links, which dates to 1922 and has a list of winners that includes Masters Tournament winner Trevor Immelman, Tim Clark and Brandt Snedeker. Also being abandoned is the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links, where Michelle Wie made history in 2003 at age 13 as the youngest winner of a USGA championship for adults.<p>The Masters has invited the winner of the Public Links each year since Ralph Howe III won the event in 1988. The Masters currently gives invitations to six amateurs each year: the U.S. Amateur winner and runner-up; the British Amateur champion; the U.S. Amateur Public Links winner; the U.S. Mid-Amateur champion; and the Asia-Pacific Amateur winner.<p>USGA vice president Thomas O'Toole Jr. said the better-ball format for the U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship should lend to more exciting golf. He also said it was gaining in popularity, with more than 150 tournaments using the format in state and regional competitions last year.<p>The sites for 2015 events have not been determined.<p>The USGA said there would be no age restriction for teams in the Four-Ball Championship, and that players do not have to belong to the same club, or even come from the same state or country. There will be 36 holes of stroke-play competition "" counting the better score of the two players on each hole "" before the field is reduced to 32 teams for the fourballs format in match play.<p>The U.S. Amateur Public Links is the fourth-oldest USGA event, and the winner gets an invitation to the Masters. It was created to provide a championship for amateur golfers from public courses, because at the time, the U.S. Amateur was only for players from USGA member clubs.<p>The U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links began in 1977.<p>The last time the USGA added a championship to its roster was in 1987 with the U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur Championship. </p></span></div>
<div><span title="Hunter Mahan, Russell Knox share Pebble Beach lead"><p>PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. ""Hunter Mahan was bracing for the worst of Pebble Beach, his golf bag weighed down with rain gear and everything else to handle nasty weather.<p>Instead, he was reminded how much he loves this place.<p>It helps that Mahan drilled a 3-wood onto the 18th green for a two-putt birdie that gave him 6-under-par 66 and a share of the lead to par with Russell Knox in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.<p>Better yet, the rain everyone was expecting early in the afternoon never showed up.<p>So when Mahan was asked about the most interesting part of the day, all he could think of was that it was boring "" in a good way.<p>"I had a good time with my partner. The pace was great. The weather was good,"ù he said. "I think the most interesting thing was we had perfect weather when it was supposed to rain at noon. We were all expecting rain. The bag probably weighs 100 pounds right now."ù<p>Mahan missed only two greens "" one of those on the edge "" and only had one birdie attempt longer than 20 feet.<p>It was a good start, but nothing more. With three very different courses in the rotation, weather that can change without notice and one course with a different par, no one has a good idea where they stand until after three rounds on Saturday.<p>Knox, who grew up in northern Scotland and has family roots in California, made the most of his limited starts on the PGA Tour. He had 6-under 64 on the Shore Course at Monterey Peninsula. Knox finished out of the top 125 on the money list last year as a rookie, so his opportunities will be limited this year.<p>"I came in here with a lot of confidence because I feel like I've been playing very well,"ù Knox said. "Just haven't had the chance to play. It was nice to get off to a good start."ù<p>The best round might have belonged to Seung-yul Noh, of South Korea, who played at Spyglass Hill. It's typically the toughest of the three courses when conditions are benign, and such was the case on Thursday.<p>Pebble and Monterey Peninsula played nearly a half-shot under par, while Spyglass was almost a half-shot over par.<p>Noh reached 7-under until making bogeys on the last two holes for 5-under 67, which only slightly soured his day. He still had the best score at Spyglass.<p>Also at 5-under are Scott Langley (65 at Monterey Peninsula) and Matt Every, who had a bogey on his final hole at Pebble Beach for 67.<p>Vijay Singh had 72 at Pebble Beach, evidence that the PGA Tour still has not decided whether he will be suspended for using deer-antler spray, according to a Sports Illustrated and later confirmed by Singh's statement last week in Phoenix.<p>The spray is said to contain an insulin-like growth hormone on the tour's list of banned substances. A decision is not expected this week.<p>Phil Mickelson, going after a record-tying fifth win in this tournament, couldn't make as many putts at Monterey Peninsula as he did in his wire-to-wire win at Phoenix Open last week. He opened with a 69 at Monterey Peninsula.<p>"One of the things I've learned over the years here is you need to be patient,"ù Mickelson said. "There's plenty of birdie holes throughout the three courses. Hopefully, I'll get a good run tomorrow and try to shoot myself up into contention."ù<p>Lee Westwood made his debut in this tournament by playing with his father, and while he had a 68, he's not sure the score had any bearing on having a good time. Westwood was at Pebble Beach, and while it was a good start for him, he made up ground in the wrong places.<p>The scoring at Pebble comes on the opening seven holes. He played those in 1 under, missed three putts inside about 12 feet. Then, he picked up four birdies over his final 10 holes.<p>"But it was nice doing it all with Dad and being able to walk the fairways,"ù Westwood said. "You sort of tick off bucket-list courses, and Pebble Beach would definitely be one of them. To actually play in a competition in the AT&T with your dad and tick that one off something really special."ù<p>About the only thing Mahan he doesn't like about this tournament are his memories, particularly two years ago. He made a furious rally on the back nine, twice was tied for the lead, and then reached the par-5 18th in two in the final round. But he three-putted for par, giving D.A. Points a cushion. Mahan was runner-up by two shots.<p>"It was disappointing to finish second in 2011, so I definitely want to win here,"ù he said. "This is an historic tournament, so I think anyone that tees it up here knows the importance of it and knows that to be a champion, what this would mean. I'm excited to be in this position right now, but obviously there's a lot of work to do. I do look forward to this every year, and definitely want to win this tournament at some point in my career."ù<p>DIVOTS: Heath Slocum made four eagles in 1,602 holes that he played on the PGA Tour last year. He made two in a 13-hole stretch on Thursday, hitting a 3-wood to 7 feet on the sixth hole at Pebble Beach and a 3-wood to 7 feet on the 18th hole. He opened with a 69. ... David Duval, making his first start of the year, opened with a 79 at Spyglass and later said on Twitter his knees were troubling him and he had a hard time walking the course. ... Geoff Ogilvy had a 73 at Spyglass. He needs to finish about fifth this week to qualify for the Match Play Championship, which he has won twice.</p></span></div>

<div><span title="Masters Week concert moves to Evans"><p>A popular annual Masters Week concert is moving to Columbia County.<p>The First Tee of Augusta officials announced Tuesday morning that the ninth annual Drive for Show, Rock Fore! Dough will be held April 9 at the Lady Antebellum Pavilion in the Evans Towne Center Park.<p>The concert "has become a hospitality and entertainment staple here in Augusta on the Tuesday of Masters Week. It's been a great success for us and a great fundraiser for us,&rdquo; First Tee Executive Director Jill Brown said. "It's still on the Tuesday of Masters Week, just in a new place.&rdquo;<p>Performers announced Tuesday include Needtobreathe and Grace Potter.<p>The concert previously was held at The First Tee facility on Damascus Road in Augusta.<p>"Our (First Tee) infrastructure is not naturally suited to be a concert venue,&rdquo; Brown said during the announcement at Towne Center Park. "This is a beautiful facility. It is a great venue for guests and it's a great venue for music.&rdquo;<p>Staging the event at First Tee long has been a challenge for organizers, who were forced to rent expensive portable stages for performers, who have included Zac Brown Band, Darius Rucker and Cheap Trick.<p>The park allows First Tee to save time and money.<p>"It's a huge financial savings for sure,&rdquo; said a Rock Fore! Dough concert producer Joe Stephenson, of GlueStick Music. "Any time you're talking about making an event better and being able to save some money and have something new to talk about too. We want to make it fresh. We want the event not to be the same old, same old. This was really a natural move for me.&rdquo;<p>It's at least the third major event that has moved to the Evans park, along with Thunder Over Augusta, which moved from downtown last year, and Papa Joe's Banjo-B-Que, which relocated from North Augusta.<p>"To say that Columbia County is excited about this move to our facility is a gross understatement,&rdquo; Columbia County Commission Chairman Ron Cross said. "We're just tickled to death that you have chosen to come out and be a part of ParTee at the Park celebration that goes on all week during Masters Week.&rdquo;<p>Stephenson said he was involved with Banjo-B-Que and was impressed with the venue.<p>"It's an easy venue,&rdquo; Stephenson said. "It's a win-win for First Tee and Columbia County.&rdquo;<p>Proceeds from the annual Rock Fore! Dough support The First Tee of Augusta, the Augusta chapter of The First Tee Network. Rock Fore! Dough raised nearly $550,000 in the previous eight years. Since it began in 1997, The First Tee opened more than 200 learning facilities worldwide, established more than 335 affiliate relationships with existing golf courses and introduced more than 2.3 million young people to golf.<p>"We're excited about being able to save funds so that we can do greater things for the youth in our community,&rdquo; Brown said. "That's really the reason we decided to give this a shot.&rdquo;<p>Tickets go on sale Feb. 23. at&nbsp;www.rockforedough.com&nbsp;and Kroger grocery stores.

The company says its deer-antler substance contains a banned performance-enhancer connected to human growth hormone.<p>Singh released a statement Wednesday at the Phoenix Open.<p>"While I have used deer-antler spray, at no time was I aware that it may contain a substance that is banned under the PGA Tour Anti-Doping Policy,&rdquo; Singh said.<p>"In fact, when I first received the product, I reviewed the list of ingredients and did not see any prohibited substances. I am absolutely shocked that deer-antler spray may contain a banned substance and am angry that I have put myself in this position. I have been in contact with the PGA Tour and am cooperating fully with their review of this matter. I will not be commenting further at this time.&rdquo;<p>PGA Tour spokesman Ty Votaw said the tour is "looking into the matter.&rdquo;<p>"I know that it's obviously illegal, whatever it is,&rdquo; Masters champion Bubba Watson said. "It sounds like something I would never want near me. &hellip; I don't even know how you take deer-antlerspray.<p>"It's sad that people live and die by their sport and they have to, I guess, cheat and go around it and try to better themselves with deer-antler spray. I'm not just going to take something and ask questions later. I'm not going to take deer antler-spray and find out what it is later. &hellip; I think we should check them for mental problems if they're taking deer-antler spray. That's kind of weird.&rdquo;<p>Singh won the last of his 34 PGA Tour titles in 2008. The three-time major champion also has 22 international victories.<p>Early in his career, he was suspended from the Asian Tour for two years for altering his scorecard during a tournament in Indonesia.<p>Doug Barron is the only player to be suspended under the tour's anti-doping policy, missing part of 2009 and most of 2010.<p>The one-year suspension was lifted in September 2010, and Barron was granted a therapeutic use exemption for low testosterone.</p></span></div>
<div><img src="http://masterssquid.augusta.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/590_wide/11937112.jpg" /><span title="Tiger Woods romps to victory at Farmers Insurance Open"><img src="http://masterssquid.augusta.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/590_wide/11937112.jpg" /><p>SAN DIEGO - Tiger Woods is a winner again at Torrey Pines, and the only question Monday was how long it would take him to finish.<p>Woods stretched his lead to eight shots in the Farmers Insurance Open before losing his focus and his patience during a painfully slow finish by the group ahead.<p>Despite dropping four shots over the last five holes, he still managed even-par 72 for a four-shot victory on the course where he has won more than any other in his pro career.<p>He won the tournament for the seventh time, one behind the record held by Sam Snead, who won the Greater Greensboro Open eight times. It was the eighth time Woods won at Torrey Pines, which includes his playoff win in the 2008 U.S Open.<p>This one was never close.<p>Woods built a six-shot lead with 11 holes to play when the final round of the fog-delayed tournament was suspended Sunday by darkness. He returned Monday - a late morning restart because CBS Sports wanted to show it in the afternoon on the East Coast - and looked stronger than ever until the tournament dragged to a conclusion.<p>Having to wait on every tee and from every fairway - or the rough, in his case - Woods made bogey from the bunker on the 14th, hooked a tee shot on the 15th that went off the trees and into a patch of ice plant and led to double bogey, and then popped up his tee shot on the 17th on his way to another bogey.<p>All that affected was the score. It kept him from another big margin of victory, though the message was clear about his game long before that.<p>One week after he missed the cut in Abu Dhabi, he ruled at Torrey Pines.<p>It was his 75th career win, seven short of the Snead's all-time tour record.<p>"It got a little ugly toward the end,&rdquo; Woods said. "I started losing patience a little bit with the slow play. I lost my concentration a little bit.&rdquo;<p>He rallied with a two-putt par on the 18th hole to win by four shots over defending champion Brandt Snedeker and Josh Teater, who had the best finish of his career.<p>Like so many of his big wins, the only drama was for second place.<p>Brad Fritsch, the rookie from Canada, birdied his last two holes for 75. That put him into a tie for ninth, however, making him eligible for the Phoenix Open next week.<p>Fritsch had been entered in the Monday qualifier that he had to abandon when the Farmers Insurance Open lost Saturday to a fog delay.<p>Woods effectively won this tournament in the final two hours Sunday, when he stretched his lead to six shots with only 11 holes to play. Nick Watney made a 10-foot birdie putt on the par-5 ninth when play resumed to get within five shots, only to drop three shots on the next five holes.<p>Everyone else started too far behind, and Woods wasn't about to come back to them.<p>Even so, the red shirt seemed to put him on edge. It didn't help that as he settled over his tee shot on the par-5 ninth, he backed off when he heard a man behind the ropes take his picture.<p>Woods rarely hits the fairway after an encounter with a camera shutter, and this was no different &ndash; it went so far right that it landed on the other side of a fence enclosing a corporate hospitality area.<p>Woods took his free drop, punched out below the trees into the fairway and then showed more irritation when his wedge nicked the flag after one hop and spun down the slope 30 feet away instead of stopping next to the hole.<p>He didn't show much reaction on perhaps his most memorable shot of the day &ndash; with his legs near the edge of a bunker some 75 feet to the left of the 11th green, he blasted out to the top shelf and watched the ball take dead aim until it stopped a foot short.<p>He failed to save par from a bunker on the 14th, and he hooked his tee shot so badly on the 15th hole that it traveled only about 225 yards before it was gobbled up by the ice plant. He had to take a penalty drop and wound up making double bogey.<p>More than his 75th career win, it was a strong opening statement for what could be a fascinating 2013.<p>Before anyone projects a monster year for Woods based on one week &ndash; especially when that week is at Torrey Pines &lt;0x2014&gt; remember that he just missed the cut last week in Abu Dhabi.<p>Woods said he wasn't playing much differently, and would have liked two more rounds in the Middle East. Instead, a two-shot penalty for a bad drop sent him home.<p>Still, in healthier and happier times he usually was sharp coming after a long layoff. Throw out the trip to the Arabian Gulf, and he is.<p>Was this a statement <p>Woods was eight shots ahead with five holes to play when he stumbled his way to the finish line, perhaps from having to kill time waiting on the group ahead. Erik Compton, Steve Marino and Fritsch had an entire par 5 open ahead of them at the end of the round.<p>Still, Woods played a different game than everyone else at Torrey Pines.<p>"I think he wanted to send a message,&rdquo; said Hunter Mahan, who shares a swing coach with Woods. "I think deep down he did. You play some games to try to motivate yourself. There's been so much talk about Rory (McIlroy). Rory is now with Nike. That would be my guess.&rdquo;<p>Mahan got a good look at Woods this week, playing in the group behind him on the front nine because Mahan was first off on the two-tee start.<p>"He looked strong,&rdquo; Mahan said. "He had great control of his swing. He was hitting some strong shots, different from any other player I saw out here.&rdquo;<p>Woods is not likely to return to golf until the Match Play Championship next month.</p></span></div>
<div><span title="Winning has been a struggle for some recent Masters champions"><p>Ask any first-time champion to describe the aftermath of winning a green jacket, and the same phrase is almost universally repeated.<p>"Life changing,&rdquo; they say in virtual harmony.<p>"More media attention. More sponsors wanting more of your time. More fans,&rdquo; said reigning Masters Tournament champion Bubba Watson of the obligations that come with a signature major victory. "Everything's just more, I guess you would say. You have to learn to deal with that and deal with the stresses.&rdquo;<p>Winning a Masters not only changes your schedule every April for the rest of your life, it alters your legacy. For some certifiable legends, it merely solidifies their established place in golf's hierarchy. But for others, a promising first draft to history doesn't always translate into a fulfilling manuscript.<p>Living up to the label of Masters champion can be tougher than getting through Augusta National's back nine on Sunday. Check out the recent rash of lingering Masters hangovers.<p>Charl Schwartzel, the 2011 winner, needed 47 starts over 20 months before finally winning again in back-to-back events in Asia and South Africa last month.<p>Angel Cabrera, the 2009 champion, went nearly four years without winning anywhere in the world until December's Argentine Open.<p>Trevor Immelman is still seeking his first victory in the injury-infused void since his breakthrough 2008 win at Augusta.<p>Among the previous five winners, only Phil Mickelson &ndash; a Hall of Famer who collected his third green jacket in 2010 &ndash; managed to notch a single victory in the immediate year after his Augusta win. Yet even Mickelson &ndash; dogged by an arthritis outbreak &ndash; waited until the eve of his Masters defense to win again in Houston and remains the only winner since Zach Johnson in 2007 to have won a tournament on U.S. soil.<p>Now comes Watson, who seems primed to end the trend of post-green jacket stress disorder if he can ever get himself up to full strength. Already with a fourth-place finish to start the season in wind-torn Kapalua despite dealing with strep throat, Watson was a late withdrawal on Thursday morning at Torrey Pines where he won in 2011.<p>"Don't have energy for golf,&rdquo; Watson tweeted, saying both he and his wife, Angie, are dealing with sickness relapses they first suffered in Hawaii.<p>Watson hopes to resume playing next week in Phoenix with one simple goal that has eluded most of his recent predecessors.<p>"For me it's about winning a golf tournament,&rdquo; Watson said.<p>Perhaps no Masters champion in history underwent more of an abrupt "life change&rdquo; than Watson. It was a transformation that started 13 days before his defining hook from the trees in the playoff. It started when he and Angie picked up their new baby boy, Caleb, after a whirlwind conclusion to their adoption quest.<p>Bubba's world would never be the same.<p>"My situation in having adopted a child the week before the Masters, when you look at it from that point of view it's made it tougher,&rdquo; he said of the transition into his post-Masters lifestyle. "Because now you have to learn how to schedule practice and golf around your child and being a dad, being a husband. Being a Masters champion plus a new dad, you're learning that same schedule but at a different magnitude, I'd say.&rdquo;<p>The magnitude was a little overwhelming at first. Watson did the expected media blitz and even followed up with a title defense in New Orleans before realizing he needed to shut things down for six weeks and establish a new baseline as a father and a player.<p>"Winning a major, winning the Masters &ndash; the biggest tournament in golf &ndash; is life changing,&rdquo; he said. "Then throwing a new child that you couldn't prepare for ... he was already a month old and doing different things in his routine and we needed to make the routine fit us. Throw the Masters on right after that, it overwhelms you. Your popularity, your focus grows to more people around you. You've got things going on that comes with it. All great things, but you've got to learn to deal with it.&rdquo;<p>After his initial reboot followed immediately by consecutive missed cuts at the Memorial and U.S. Open, Watson acquitted himself in the manner befitting a Masters champion for the rest of 2012. Other than one additional missed cut in Boston, Watson's worst finish the rest of the PGA Tour season was tied for 23rd in the British Open. He had six top-20 finishes, including runner-up in Hartford and a tie for fifth in the Tour Championship at East Lake.<p>"Somehow golf has to get back in the picture,&rdquo; Watson said of his escalating workload. "Doing that in a short period of time is hard. I missed the first two cuts. I wasn't sure how to practice or my time schedule at tournaments. I finished second my third tournament out. So I was getting a little better and think I'm getting a little better now.&rdquo;<p>Perhaps Watson and his fellow green-cloaked brethren are emerging from the doldrums. Tiger Woods started winning again in 2012. Mickelson is still Mickelson. Schwartzel is back on track. Cabrera found a spark in his homeland.<p>Once Watson's family can shake the flu and start pointing toward a return to Augusta, maybe he can build on the foundation of his life-changing two weeks last spring.<p>"I'm finally in a routine and we have it situated the right way,&rdquo; he said. "If I won the Masters again, it would probably mess the whole routine up. But it would be a good thing to have to always deal with that every year.&rdquo;</p></span></div>

Gay won on the par-4 10th, hitting a perfect drive and putting his 145-yard second shot in good position below the hole.

The Australian is ranked No. 51 in the world and will have to win a qualifying PGA Tour event early in 2013 or finish among the top 50 in the rankings the week before the Masters.<p>Olesen and Ogilvy switched places in the ranking from the week before even though Olesen sat out this past week and Ogilvy tied for fourth at the Australian PGA. The formula used by the world ranking calculates an average based on points earned per tournament over a two-year period.<p>Ogilvy's best finish in 2012 on the PGA Tour was a tie for ninth at the British Open.<p>Olesen, who will celebrate his 23rd birthday Friday, also tied for ninth at the British Open. On the European Tour, he won the Sicilian Open and had three other top-five finishes this year.<p>Joining Olesen as first-timers through the final world ranking are South Africa's Branden Grace and George Coetzee, Belgium's Nicolas Colsaerts and Wales's Jamie Donaldson.<p>Paul Lawrie, Francesco Molinari, Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano, Bill Haas, Jason Day, Hiroyuki Fujita, Matteo Manassero and Thomas Bjorn all earned repeat trips to Augusta.<p>Ten other golfers, including 14-year-old Tianlang Guan, of China, had previously qualified for their first Masters.<p>Ogilvy is not the only prominent player in danger of missing the tournament. Two-time Masters runner-up Retief Goosen has slipped to 107th in the ranking and could miss out for the second year in a row.<p>Players with Augusta-area ties also have yet to qualify. Charles Howell is ranked the highest at No. 117. <p>The 2013 Masters will be held April 11-14.</p></span></div>
<div><span title="Chinese teen earns Masters berth with win in Asia-Pacific Amateur"><p>The youngest competitor in Masters Tournament history is still in middle school, likes Tiger Woods and uses a belly putter.<p>Other than that, Guan Tianlang, of China, is a normal teenager.<p>Guan, 14, won the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship on Sunday to earn the automatic berth in the 2013 Masters.<p>He shot 1-under-par 71 at Amata Spring Country Club near Bangkok to capture the tournament by one shot over Cheng-tsung Pan, of Taiwan, who closed with 65. Oliver Goss, of Australia, was third, and two-time defending champion Hideki Matsuyama, of Japan, finished with 68 to finish fourth.<p>The winner also received an exemption to the final stage of qualifying for the British Open. But the buzz Sunday was about his expectations for next spring. Previously, the youngest competitor in Masters history was Matteo Manassero, of Italy, who was 16 in 2010.<p>"I'm really excited about it,&rdquo; Guan said on a conference call. "I'm really looking forward to it.&rdquo;<p>Guan opened the tournament with rounds of 66 and 64 to open a five-shot lead. But he came back to the field with an even-par 72 in the third round, setting the stage for Sunday's drama.<p>With Pan making a charge, Guan played steady golf. Pan was one hole ahead of Guan, and narrowly missed a birdie putt on the final hole. Knowing he needed a par on the difficult final hole, a par 4 of 477 yards, Guan hit the fairway with his tee shot. His 3-wood second shot came up short right, and he faced a long pitch to the back left pin.<p>He nearly holed the chip, but it ran past the hole about five feet. Guan sank that putt for the one-shot win and trip to Augusta.<p>"I just focused on my game and do my own routine,&rdquo; Guan said.<p>Guan took up the game when he was 4 or 5 he said, and he would often follow his parents to the golf course. He now spends the summer months training in California.<p>"I usually train in Los Angeles and San Diego, and I just stay in a friend's house and go to play with the juniors in America,&rdquo; Guan said. "So nothing special.&rdquo;<p>He has been in the spotlight before. He played in the China Open this spring, and was the youngest player, at 13, to ever compete at a European Tour event. In 2011, he won his age division (11-12) by 11 shots at the Junior World Golf Championships in San Diego.<p>Guan credited the belly putter for his success on the greens.<p>"I started using it in June this year and I think it's more stable, so I just use it,&rdquo; he said. "And this week, my putting was pretty nice, 25, 22 putts in the first two rounds. So it really helps me.&rdquo;<p>The slender Guan hits the ball about 250 yards off the tee, which might make it tough for him to get around Augusta National Golf Club's layout that plays more than 7,000 yards.<p>"I will be training maybe a little bit harder to got some more power for that because I'm still growing right now,&rdquo; he said. "So it will be great fun.&rdquo;<p>Golf is extremely popular in China, and Guan thinks his Masters appearance will only add to it.<p>"I think you get more people that know about golf and more people support for the golf in China,&rdquo; he said. "And it's really good for the Chinese golf.&rdquo;<p>He said he doesn't want to think too much about the upcoming trip, or who he will try to play practice rounds with. Woods, a four-time Masters winner, seems to be a likely choice if Guan has his way.<p>"I think he has a strong mind and strong heart,&rdquo; he said of the golfer he's already met twice. "So I think that's why he's so great, a good player.&rdquo;</p></span></div>

Bob Austin, of Augusta Planning and Development, said the plan shows a large, two-level structure will be built, with the lower level sitting below grade.<p>"Looks like they are doing some major renovations to the existing clubhouse,&rdquo; Austin said after reviewing the plans, which were filed in May.<p>Austin said the plans did not indicate the square footage of the proposed structure but that it appeared to be substantial.<p>Augusta National spokesman Steve Ethun could not provide any details on the plans, saying the private club does not comment on internal improvement projects.<p>Marshall Masters, of Augusta Licensing and Inspection, said there have been discussions with club representatives about the project but that no building plans had been filed, nor had any permits been requested.<p>The building that became the clubhouse was constructed in 1854 as the home of indigo plantation owner Dennis Redmond, according to club history. The plans do not indicate any changes to the iconic original structure.<p>Several changes and additions have been made to the clubhouse through the years, including the addition in 1946 of a bachelor wing, suites building, trophy room and kitchen. A golf shop was added in 1953, and the grill room was added in 1962, according to club literature. The remodeling in 2003 of the grill room and locker room was the last major change.</p></span></div>
