"I don't think 73's going to do an awful lot of damage. I still feel like I'm going to have a chance.&rdquo;</p><p>Rose, hampered by a nagging back injury that kept him from speaking to the media after his round, slipped to 3-over 75 and dropped to even-par 216 for the tournament, tied for 18th.</p><p>Lynn fell the hardest, ballooning to 8-over 80, which dropped him to 5-over 221 and tied for 44th.</p><p>"It just showed me how easy you can rack up a number,&rdquo; said Lynn, who had fired a first-round 68 and followed with a solid 73 on Friday. "It was just one of those things. I felt as good as I felt the first two days, but things just got away from me.&rdquo;</p><p>Of the three Brits who began the day three shots back and well within striking distance of second-round leader Jason Day, only Westwood was able to keep his round together. He made bogeys at Nos. 4 and 7 and slipped to 1-under before finishing his front nine with a birdie he hoped would jump-start a back-nine charge.</p><p>Instead, Westwood ho-hummed his way home. He parred each hole on the back nine, unable to capitalize on any of the birdie chances he gave himself.</p><p>In particular, Westwood said, his performance on the par-5s proved to be the difference between a solid round and one that could have vaulted him squarely into contention. He parred all four, squandering his best chances for birdie despite being in position off the tee.</p><p>"I just didn't make up enough on the par-5s,&rdquo; he said. "I would have liked to have birdied 8 &ndash; that was the easiest flag of the week on that hole. And I didn't get 13 or 15 when I had chances.&rdquo;</p><p>Rose actually got to 4 under with birdie on No. 3. He followed with bogey on the next hole and bogeyed No. 7, too, before a double bogey on No. 12 dropped him back to even.</p><p>Doing what Westwood couldn't &ndash; making birdie on both par-5s on the back &ndash; Rose rallied to get back to 2-under. But bogeys at 16 and 18 derailed his round late.</p><p>A bogey-bogey start for Lynn was merely an indicator of what was to come. After making six birdies in his opening round, he has had only two since and only one Saturday, at No. 6.</p><p>That momentarily got him back under par, but heimmediately gave it back, and the back nine was a complete struggle as he finished with 41.</p></p></span></div>

In the 15-step outline of the work, the 14th step says: "The area is smoothed and firmed. Another laser scan confirms that the elevation is back to its original grade.&rdquo;</p><p>According to masters.com, "Typically, one or two greens per year undergo a masterful renovation that uses the latest in technology to ensure near-perfect consistency.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom Watson, who has won two Masters titles in his 39 appearances, didn't see a change on the 14th green.</p><p>Mickelson did, and he thinks the change will make the hole play easier when the traditional Saturday pin is placed in that area &ndash; unless the shot is long.</p><p>Any helpful change would be welcomed on that green, which has more undulations than any on the course. Despite the fact that it is the only hole on the course without a bunker, the par-4 14th played as the 12th-toughest hole in 2012, with a 4.09 scoring average.</p><p>"You honestly wouldn't even notice it (the change) if you had not had years of knowing that green,&rdquo; said Mickelson, a three-time Mas&shy;ters champion who is making his 21st appearance at Augusta National. "But the difference is the pin position that I've holed out in 2010 in that little low section to the left, behind it, there's a backstop now whereas before it would take the ball directly to the right behind the hole 12 feet. Now, it's pitched a little bit more back where it will bring it back to the hole. Which means that it's very possible that you might see more hole-outs to that pin position.</p><p>"If you go long, though, I don't think you can get it close, because of the pitch from back to front now is more severe on those last four feet.&rdquo;</p><p>Crenshaw, who will be playing in his 42nd Masters, said, "I did notice there's a little dug-out spot in the middle of the crease as it starts to go back down (toward the back). It used to be more of a continual slope. I think this probably creates a bit more spacing for pins, but it's subtle. It's not much, but it's enough.&rdquo;</p><p>Crenshaw said the change is "one way to enlarge the area for potential pin positions.&rdquo;</p><p>"It's more in the back-center,&rdquo; he said. "It might create a little more room on the left. There was that little basin where they used to put the pin and where a lot of people got close on Saturday when they put it back there. Still, if they put the pins close to the crowns in front, that is still very tough. That really hasn't changed.&rdquo;</p><p>Such a change on No. 14 wouldn't be noticed by Bel&shy;gium's Nicolas Colsaerts, a Mas&shy;ters rookie. He did notice how much more definition there was as he hit his approach shots to the green with fans surrounding them Monday."When you come here and there's no one around, it's very difficult to picture the shots,&rdquo; he said. "But once everybody settles in and sits around the green, everything shapes up in a certain way that it's quite appealing. In a way, it's easy to picture your shots into the greens. Of course, you're going to have to get it right and all these slopes can play tricks.&rdquo;</p><p>In general, Colsaerts has found the course "is much more subtle than I thought. You think that after watching it for so many years, you have an idea of what it's going to be like, but everything is accentuated by a thousand times.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span></div>
