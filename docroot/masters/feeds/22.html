Through numerous innovations implemented under Roberts, the Masters is considered the premier sporting event in the world.</p><p>He also enjoyed a close relationship with Dwight D. Eisenhower, and helped the general in his successful bid for president. Eisenhower also became an Augusta National member.</p><p>Roberts served as chairman from 1931 to 1976, and after his death in September 1977 he was named chairman in memoriam.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span></div>

He looked like a winner in 2011, but a final-round 80 pushed him all the way down to a tie for 15th.</p><p>Last year, McIlroy tied for 25th as he struggled with changes in his equipment.</p></p></span></div>
<div><img src="http://www.augusta.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/590_wide/MAS40_Champions_Dinner_RLC.jpg" /><span title="Champions Dinner will include Mum's dessert, 'bugs'"><img src="http://www.augusta.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/590_wide/MAS40_Champions_Dinner_RLC.jpg" /><p>Adam Scott says he has finalized his Australian-themed menu for the Champions Dinner, but the reigning Masters Tournament champion wasn't ready to reveal all of it just yet.But he did offer a couple of clues."My mom's dessert's on there," Scott said after practicing his putting on Tuesday at PGA National, where he's preparing to return from a six-week break to play in the Honda Classic. "Mum's Pavlova is on there. It's kind of a meringue."A Pavlova is considered a fresh fruit pie with a meringue crust. It's named after a Russian ballerina, Anna Pavlova, who toured Australia and New Zealand in 1926. The dessert is considered "as light as Pavlova."According to Linda Stradley in What's Cooking America, the origin of the dessert is yet another point of contention between Australia and New Zealand."While it has been suggested this dessert was created in New Zealand, it has also become recognized as a popular Australian dish," she wrote. "Both countries claim to have invented this dessert and claim it as their national dish."So perhaps it's a tip of the cap to Scott's caddie Steve Williams, the New Zealander who gave Scott the correct read on the Masters winning putt on the second playoff hole.Scott's mother, Pam, will not be personally making the treats that will end the Champions Dinner."It's her recipe, but she's not actually going to be there making it," Scott said. "I don't know if I want her up there with Arnold (Palmer) and Jack (Nicklaus). I don't know if she can handle the pressure."</p><p>As for the rest of Scott's menu, he lit up when asked specifically if Moreton Bay Bugs would be served. The "bugs" are really a specia of slipper lobster found in Moreton Bay near Brisbane, the capital city in Queensland where Scott grew up on the Gold Coast. Locals liken it to crayfish."Moreton Bay Bugs is one of my favorites," Scott said. "It's a good guess. It's a very good guess. I hope (the other champions) won't be put off by the bugs. They'll like it."</p></p></span></div>

The 23-year-old played impressive golf in reaching the finals of the Match Play Championship, and he made a pair of incredible par saves in his loss to Jason Day.</p></p></span></div>

Eisenhower and his love affair with Augusta. His memory lives on at Augusta National and around Augusta:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;EISENHOWER&nbsp;CABIN: Built in 1953 by a group of 50&nbsp;Augusta&nbsp;National&nbsp;members who bought building certificates, the cabin was built to specifications of presidential security. Secret Service agents occupied the bottom floor, while the&nbsp;Eisenhower&nbsp;family had the rest of the spacious cabin to themselves during visits. Numerous family mementos are still in place, and the cabin is available to club members for use.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IKE'S POND: Now an integral part of the Par-3 course, the spring-fed pond occupies three acres. During his second visit to&nbsp;AugustaNational,&nbsp;Eisenhower&nbsp;was walking on the eastern part of the property and discovered what he thought would be an ideal spot for a fish pond.&nbsp;Eisenhower&nbsp;told Clifford Roberts about his discovery - he even had a suggestion for where the dam should be located - and the pond was promptly built.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EISENHOWER&nbsp;CRACKER BARREL: Located in the pro shop, the barrel was presented by George M. Humphrey in 1957. Humphrey was a member of&nbsp;Eisenhower's&nbsp;Cabinet and was a fellow club member. The inscription reads: ``This wood was part of the White House roof erected about 1817 and removed in 1927.'' Plenty of other Eisenhower items are scattered throughout the clubhouse.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; CHURCH TRIBUTE: At Reid Memorial Presbyterian Church in Augusta, &nbsp; Eisenhower usually sat on the third pew on the left, facing the altar. Across the aisle, a stained glass window features a likeness of him in a scene depicting the three wise men offering gifts to the baby Jesus. &nbsp;After&nbsp;Eisenhower's&nbsp;death, Reid honored the former president with a plaque on the pew where he and his family sat. Also at the service Feb. 6, 1972, the Redemption Window, in the church's balcony, was dedicated to his memory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span></div>
