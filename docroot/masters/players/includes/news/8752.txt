<div class="player-story-date">Posted: 04/11/09</div>
<div class="player-story-digest">I'm very disappointed. It's about the worst I could've possibly scored. I played all right. On shots around the hole I played decent. I just didn't score very well. Pretty much every time I missed the green, every time I hit it in the bunker or around the green, it was a bad lie and it was almost impossible to get up and down.</div>

<div class="player-story-digest">I dropped some stuff over at the house and went over to Forest Hills and watched the (Augusta State) guys for about a half-hour. I really didn't get much time to be out there. They looked like they were doing pretty well. Back-to-back victories is pretty impressive. It's good to see them in form. Hopefully, I can get in that form for this week.</div>

<div class="player-story-digest">I'm feeling good. My two top-10 finishes in the World Golf Championships events have been a great start to my American swing. I'm not playing loads, but I've had a few good tournaments going into Masters Week, which was the main one I wanted to prepare for. I've been looking forward to it, really. The first time is going to be fun.</div>
