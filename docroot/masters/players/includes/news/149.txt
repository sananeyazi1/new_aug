<div class="player-story-digest">The traditional Sunday roars echoed through the pines at Augusta National Golf Club -- perhaps at an unprecedented rate -- for the final round at the Masters Tournament. In a break from tradition, few were for Phil Mickelson. The three-time Masters winner typically lurks near the top of the Sunday leaderboard, but he posted a quiet 2-over-par 74, however, to finish tied for 27th at 1-under.</div>

<div class="player-story-digest">Phil Mickelson isn't one for concession speeches, and he wasn't ready to concede this Masters Tournament after signing his scorecard Saturday. The defending champion didn't do himself any favors Saturday, but few players in the field have put together long strings of birdies the way Mickelson has in the past -- and he'll aim for one of those hot streaks in today's final round.</div>

<div class="player-story-digest">Phil Mickelson walked off the 18th green at Augusta National Golf Club on Friday with the confidence and swagger of a man ready to win his fourth green jacket. The fact that he was eight strokes behind leader Rory McIlroy at the time and tied for 20th after a mediocre round of even-par 72 with four birdies and four bogeys didn't seem to phase him.</div>
