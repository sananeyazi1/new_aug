<div class="player-story-digest">The weight of an impatient continent rests on Rory McIlroy's young shoulders in today's final round of the 75th Masters Tournament.

McIlroy came to life with birdies on two of his final four holes to shoot  2-under-par 70 on Saturday and double his 36-hole lead from two to four shots.</div>
