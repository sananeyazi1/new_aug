<div class="player-story-digest">Even if Luke Donald didn't want to know where he was on the board as he made a charge, it would be a challenge to stay oblivious to it all.  Donald, who is trying to become the first player to win the Par-3 Contest and the green jacket in the same year, had 3-under 69 on Saturday to stay in contention.</div>

<div class="player-story-digest">With his 4-under-par 68 on Friday, Luke Donald put himself in position to challenge for his first Masters Tournament title.

<div class="player-story-digest">Luke Donald came to the final hole of the Par-3 Contest with two options: hit a ball into the water or go for the win, knowing that no Par-3 winner has ever won the Masters Tournament in the same year. Donald is not superstitious. He made birdie and carded a 5-under-par 22, winning by one stroke over Raymond Floyd and Angel Cabrera.</div>
