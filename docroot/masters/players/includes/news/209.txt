<div class="player-story-digest">Retief Goosen jumped to the lead of the Masters Tournament early Thursday when his ball dove into the cup on the first hole for an eagle. After a birdie on the par-5 15th, only Rory McIlroy stood between the two-time U.S. Open winner and the top. But Goosen stumbled down the stretch, bogeying the last three holes to card 70 -- five shots off the pace.</div>
