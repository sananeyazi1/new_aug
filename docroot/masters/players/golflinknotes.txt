It appears that the trigger that is supposed to fire on insert to get
the next value for the PKID is not present.  This is specific to the
GOLF.EVENT table.  Because this did not fire, the inserted PKID was
probably blank therefore an exception raised.

I am not sure how, when or if the trigger was removed.

There is also a possibility that this was not triggered but the SQL in
the application selected the next value in the sequence and used it in
the insert statement.  This would imply a permissions issue.  I have
verified that the sequence is operational.

(select golf.event_seq.nextval from dual)  or insert into ...
(event-id,... ) values (golf.event_seq.nextval,...)

I manually added a new EVENT row for this year's Masters tournament and
verified with Kim that the GolfLink application is operational.
